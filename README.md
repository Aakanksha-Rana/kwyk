# neuro_nn

Attempting to create a neural network to identify brains in structural magnetic resonance images.


# Procedure

1. Using anatomical volumes and 3D brain masks from http://openneu.ro/metasearch/, construct an HDF5 file with anatomical and brain mask slices. Start with axial slices, but add more in the future.
